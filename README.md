# Pattern Classification and Sensor Applications 

 This project presents an innovative approach to automate the classification of Turkish Lira banknotes, utilizing advanced techniques in both image processing and neural networks for accurate recognition. The methodology involves a comprehensive data preprocessing phase, encompassing tasks such as image resizing, grayscale conversion, and thresholding to achieve effective binarization. A pivotal step includes the extraction of Regions of Interest (ROIs), focusing on crucial components of the banknotes to establish a standardized dataset for subsequent neural network training. The neural network architecture, featuring two hidden layers with 6 and 3 neurons, strategically employs the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for efficient training. The model demonstrates remarkable accuracy during the training phase, successfully capturing distinctive patterns associated with each banknote. The testing phase on previously unseen banknote images further substantiates the system's efficacy, showcasing its potential applications in diverse sectors, including banking and retail. Potential avenues for future work include expanding the dataset, refining the neural network architecture, and exploring real-time implementation possibilities. This project positions itself at the forefront of automated currency recognition research, contributing to the evolving landscape of innovative technological solutions.
